# pycsou
Pycsou is a Python 3 package for solving finite-dimensional linear inverse problems with state-of-the-art iterative first order proximal algorithms. To this end, it leverages a versatile and generic penalised convex optimisation framework and implements in a highly modular way its main building blocks: cost functionals, regularisation terms and linear operators.
