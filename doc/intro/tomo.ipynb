    "## Tomographic Reconstruction in a Nutshell\n",
    "\n",
    "Tomographic reconstruction is a computational process used in imaging sciences to reconstruct 2D or 3D images from a\n",
    "series of projections captured at different angles. The term \"tomography\" stems from the Greek words \"tomo,\" meaning\n",
    "\"slice\" or \"section,\" and \"graph,\" meaning \"to write\" or \"to record.\" In essence, tomography aims to construct a\n",
    "representation of an object by investigating its internal structure slice-by-slice. This method has wide-ranging\n",
    "applications, from medical imaging like [CT scans](https://www.radiologyinfo.org/en/info.cfm?pg=bodyct) to industrial\n",
    "quality control, [seismology](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/glossary/?term=seismic%20tomography), material science,\n",
    "and [astronomy](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-astro-081817-051819). For a deeper understanding,\n",
    "various [resources](http://www.slaney.org/pct/pct-toc.html) on the mathematical and computational aspects are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental principle behind tomographic reconstruction is the Radon transform, maps a function in 2D or 3D space to\n",
    "a set of line integrals. In the context of medical imaging, for example, these line integrals represent the attenuation\n",
    "of X-rays as they pass through a human body. By capturing these attenuations from various angles, it is possible to\n",
    "reconstruct a cross-sectional image of the internal structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process typically involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Acquisition:** Projection data is gathered from different angles, typically by rotating the X-ray source and\n",
    "   detector around the object being imaged.\n",
    "2. **Back-Projection:** The acquired projection data is then 'smeared' back across the imaging field for each angle.\n",
    "3. **Reconstruction:** Various algorithms, such as Filtered Back-Projection (FBP) or iterative methods, are used to\n",
    "   compute the original image from the smeared data."

    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we explore the challenges of working with a non-idealized parallel-beam tomographic setup that\n",
    "deviates from the assumptions usually made by traditional Radon transform models. The complexities of our setup include:\n",
    "\n",

    "  *sinogram* â€”a data representation that stacks horizontally 1D projections of an object at various angles.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **X-ray Beam Intensity**: The X-ray beam's intensity tapers towards the edges, causing a similar 'tapering' effect in\n",
    "  the sinogram columns, which complicates the application of the standard Radon transform.\n",

    "### Plug-and-Play Reconstruction Schemes\n",
    "\n",
    "We conclude this tutorial with a simple Plug-and-Play (PnP) reconstruction scheme. The latter offer a modern, versatile\n",
    "approach to image reconstruction that seamlessly combines data fidelity and prior knowledge. These schemes alternate\n",
    "between gradient steps, which aim to keep the solution consistent with observed data, and denoising steps, which\n",
    "introduce prior information to regularize the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### PnP Priors: Implicit and Intuitive\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the unique characteristics of PnP schemes is the use of implicit priors. Instead of using an explicitly defined\n",
    "mathematical function to model the prior, a denoising algorithm is used. This innovative step replaces the proximity\n",
    "operator commonly used in classical optimization with a denoiser, thereby expanding the range of prior models that can\n",
    "be incorporated into the reconstruction process. This implicitness allows for great flexibility and can accommodate more\n",
    "complex structures in the data, which might not be easily expressible in mathematical terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key intuition behind PnP is simple yet powerful: if a denoising algorithm can effectively remove noise from an\n",
    "image, then it likely encapsulates some underlying \"truth\" or \"structure\" of the image, which can serve as a good prior.\n",
    "Essentially, the denoising algorithm embodies our prior beliefs about what the solution should look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "In real-world applications, a variety of denoising algorithms have found their way into PnP frameworks, each offering\n",
    "its own set of advantages and limitations. Here are some commonly used denoisers that can act as implicit priors in PnP\n",
    "schemes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **BM3D (Block-Matching and 3D Filtering)**: A highly effective denoiser, popular in medical imaging. It\n",
    "  collaboratively filters 3D data blocks.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Non-Local Means**: Averages similar pixels from the entire image, effectively preserving textures.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Wavelet-based Denoising**: Uses wavelet transforms for multi-resolution analysis, isolating and removing noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deep Learning-based Denoisers**: Algorithms like DnCNN adapt to various noise types and often outperform traditional\n",
    "  methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Total Variation Denoising**: Minimizes the total variation of the image, effectively removing noise while keeping\n",
    "  edges sharp.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Equations\n",
    "PnP methods are typically found in two forms: proximal or differentiable. \n",
    "\n",
    "In its proximal form, a typical PnP algorithm can be represented by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f^{k+1} = \\text{Denoiser}_{\\sigma}(f^k - \\tau \\nabla F(f^k)),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\nabla F(x)$ is the gradient term ensuring data fidelity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In differential form, influenced by the regularization by denoising (RED) framework, the equation can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f^{k+1} = f^k - \\tau \\left[\\nabla F(f^k) + \\lambda(f^k- \\text{Denoiser}_{\\sigma}(f^k))\\right],\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\lambda$ encodes the PnP prior strength. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **_NOTE:_** Tweedie's formula tells us that when $\\text{Denoiser}_{\\sigma}$ is an MMSE Gaussian denoiser, we should\n",
    "> choose $\\lambda = 1/\\sigma$ (where $\\sigma$ is the noise level). The term $\\frac{1}{\\sigma}(f^k-\n",
    "> \\text{Denoiser}_{\\sigma}(f^k))$ can then be understood as the    approximate score (gradient) of the distribution of\n",
    "> natural images convolved with a Gaussian with standard deviation $\\sigma$. \n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding and applying these principles, one can utilize PnP schemes to achieve high-quality image\n",

    "advantages that come with implicit priors."
