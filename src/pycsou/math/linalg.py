def hutchpp(linop, m: int = 4002, gpu: bool = False):
    r"""
    Computes an stocastic estimate of the trace for linear operators based on the Hutch++ algorithm (specifically,
    algorithm 3 of the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09649.

    Parameters
    ----------
    linop: :py:class:`~pycsou.abc.operator.LinOp`
        Linear operator object compliant with Pycsou's interface with square shape.
    m: int
        The number of queries desired to estimate the trace of the linear operator. ``m`` is set to 4002 by default,
        based on the analysis of variance described in theorem 10 of the Hutch++ paper. This default number of queries
        corresponds to having an estimation error smaller than 0.01 with a probability of 0.9.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Hutch++ stochastic estimate of the trace.

    Notes
    -----
    This function calls Scipyâ€™s function: :py:func:`scipy.sparse.linalg.qr`. See the documentation of this function
    for more information on its behaviour and the underlying LAPACK routines it relies on.
