# This stub file should contain the test suite of pycsou.operator.interop.source.from_source().
#
# from_source() is a low-level function used throughout the Pycsou API; as such it is indirectly
# tested through concrete instantiations in:
#    pycsou.operator.linop.base.py
#    pycsou.abc.arithmetic.py
#    (and many others)
#
# Should specific tests be added in the future, they will be inserted here.
