* nd arithmetic
* [doc] Fix missing reference warnings. (See build/html/WARNINGS.log)
* use pycrt.coerce() where it makes sense.
* use **kwargs to simplify signatures

@Matthieu: Remarks from Sepand
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Median.lipschitz == 1?
* LeastSquares.lipschitz == inf/2 -> ok
* L2.lipschitz/diff_lip == 1/inf -> ok, proxfunc, so no diff_lip
* L1.lipschitz != 1? -> fails a test
  lipschitz = sqrt(n)
* DiffMap example .jacobian() -> should be ExplicitLinOp(np.diag(np.cos(arr))) -> ok
* prox/fenchel_prox: tau == 0 forbidden -> be explicit in docs
* modify specialize/squeeze to return self when possible
* proxfunc


Sepand
------

* Operator tests

  Problems
  ^^^^^^^^

  * MapT.test_specialize() skipped -> enable once scaffolding in place.
  * Func.squeeze() fails FuncT.test_squeeze() -> deactivated for now.
  * DiffMap.test_interface_jacobian() fails since LinOpT not defined -> deactivated for now.


* Arithmetic tests
* Solver tests [APGD for now]

----

* add from_source() method for creating class objects by passing their abstract methods as arguments (for Map and all of its subclasses).
* add LinOp class method from_[array/sciop/pylop]() to create explicit linear operators from arrays/scipy/pylop operators.
* [operator.ProxFunc] moreau_envelope(mu) -> must fail for mu = 0 [Not a DiffFunc]
* [operator] See various TODOs in file abc/operator.py: Hutch++ algorithm high priority
* [linop/base] Implement diagonal operator
* [opt] Implement Solver.CG, LSQR LSMR
* SVG drawing of class diagrams
* [tox] Verify tests run correctly in py38 environment.

  We use `tox` to run pycsou's test suite and ensure the package is useable under multiple Python
  versions. Since pycsou depends on numerical libraries, we rely on `tox-conda` to create the
  necessary virtual environments via `conda`.

  Problem: it is unclear if tests actually are executing in testenvs py38 and minReq using
  Python3.8. I'm sure the interpreter in {py38,minReq} are Python3.8, but for some reason L13 in
  tox.ini calls Python3.9 on my system.

  My hunch is that since `pytest` is listed as external command in tox.ini, it is allowed to
  execute the test suite. However, since pycsou is installed in non-dev mode in the virtual
  environments, `pytest` does not exist there -> default to outer pytest command for execution.

  Goal: investigate how to get pytest to run the tests in each virtual environment using the right
  interpreter. I expect some tests to fail in Python3.8 since we may be using language constructs
  which were introduced in Python3.9+.

* create benchmark suite for all operators.

  We must track the runtime of operator methods across commits to identify performance regressions and fix them. A comprehensive benchmark suite is therefore required.

  Desired output: DataFrame with
  * row: class.method
  * column: commit name
  * value: execution time [s] (on sample data, identical throughout the commit history.)

  This data can then be plotted to visualize performance changes.

* StoppingCriterion:

  * Add carbon_footprint
  * Add duality_gap
