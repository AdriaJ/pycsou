* nd arithmetic
* [doc] Fix missing reference warnings. (See build/html/WARNINGS.log)
* use pycrt.coerce() where it makes sense.
* use **kwargs to simplify signatures

* Operator tests

  Problems
  ^^^^^^^^

  * MapT.test_specialize() skipped -> enable once scaffolding in place.
  * Func.squeeze() fails FuncT.test_squeeze() -> deactivated for now.
  * test_math_() routines should be conducted for each precision to ensure pre-conditions hold.

* Arithmetic tests
* Solver tests [APGD for now]
* Go over all code: refactor docstrings, type hints, etc.

* [operator] See various TODOs in file abc/operator.py
* [linop/base] Implement diagonal operator
* [opt] Implement LSQR LSMR
* Add SVG drawing of class diagrams in documentation
* [tox] Verify tests run correctly in py38 environment.

  Assigned by Sepand KASHANI

  We use `tox` to run pycsou's test suite and ensure the package is useable under multiple Python
  versions.

  Problem: The codebase contains 3.9+ constructs; hence `tox -e py38` fails due to parsing errors.
  Goal: Assess whether "porting" to allow 3.8 is worth it, or just stick to 3.9+.

* create benchmark suite for all operators.

  We must track the runtime of operator methods across commits to identify performance regressions and fix them. A comprehensive benchmark suite is therefore required.

  Desired output: DataFrame with
  * row: class.method
  * column: commit name
  * value: execution time [s] (on sample data, identical throughout the commit history.)

  This data can then be plotted to visualize performance changes.

* StoppingCriterion:

  * Add carbon_footprint
  * Add duality_gap




  Roadmap:
  - Numpy ufuncs -> Kaan
  - operators (Pycsou v1) -> core dev team
  - functionals (Pycsou v1 but unify loss and reg with 1 class and method "asloss") -> Kaan
  - Tutorials, examples and notebooks. -> Kaan
  - CI: pip/conda packaging (quick fix of pip lenghty install) + ReadTheDocs + Run tests in cloud (Infomaniak)
  - benchmarking suite (low priority)
  - Automatic hyperparameter tuning (hyperpriors) 
  - Uncertainty quantification (approximate credibility intervals)
  - Nonconvex/linear (APGD nonconvex + PDS nonlinear)
  - Pytorch interfacing (autodiff+jac+bwd eval) -> Alec
  - Stochastic solvers -> Alec
  - Second order solvers -> Kaan
  - LSQR/LSMR -> Kaan
