  We use `tox` to run pycsou's test suite and ensure the package is useable under multiple Python
  versions. Since pycsou depends on numerical libraries, we rely on `tox-conda` to create the
  necessary virtual environments via `conda`.

  Problem: it is unclear if tests actually are executing in testenvs py38 and minReq using
  Python3.8. I'm sure the interpreter in {py38,minReq} are Python3.8, but for some reason L13 in
  tox.ini calls Python3.9 on my system.

  My hunch is that since `pytest` is listed as external command in tox.ini, it is allowed to
  execute the test suite. However, since pycsou is installed in non-dev mode in the virtual
  environments, `pytest` does not exist there -> default to outer pytest command for execution.

  Goal: investigate how to get pytest to run the tests in each virtual environment using the right
  interpreter. I expect some tests to fail in Python3.8 since we may be using language constructs
  which were introduced in Python3.9+.
